UniForm
=======

A plugin for generating forms using http://sprawsm.com/uni-form

Installation
============

You will need to install the uni-form stylesheets into your stylesheet folder.

Javascript
----------

Depending on which Javascript library you are using in your application you will need to install the correct
supporting Javascript file.

If using JQuery (for example via JRails) then you can use the included JQuery javascript (included with the 
base uni-form package).

If using Prototype you will need to install the Prototype support javascript from http://sprawsm.com/uni-form/community/discussion/14/prototype-support-by-patrick-daether

If using mootools you will need to install the javascript from
http://sprawsm.com/uni-form/community/discussion/27/mootools-support

Usage
=====

Include the Javascript file (probably in your layout):

<%= javascript_include_tag 'uni-form.prototype.js' %>

Include the stylesheet (again, probably in your layout):

<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'uni-form', :media => "all" %>	

Then, to create your form you can do the following:

<% uni_form_for :user do |form| %>
	<% form.fieldset :type => "block", :legend => "cool stuff" do %>
		<%= form.text_field :first_name, :required => true, :label => "Your first name" %>
		<%= form.text_field :last_name %>
	<% end %>
	<%= form.submit "save" %>
<% end %>
